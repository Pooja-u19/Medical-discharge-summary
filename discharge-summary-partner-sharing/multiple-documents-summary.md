# Multiple Document Upload Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ What I've Implemented:

### 1. **Modern Drag & Drop Interface**
- Replaced single file input with Mantine Dropzone component
- Supports drag & drop or click to browse
- Visual feedback with upload icon and clear instructions

### 2. **Multiple File Support**
- Users can now select and upload multiple documents at once
- Supports various file types:
  - PDF documents (.pdf)
  - Images (JPG, PNG, TIFF)
  - Word documents (.doc, .docx)
  - Text files (.txt)

### 3. **Enhanced File Management**
- File preview list showing all selected documents
- Individual file removal with trash icon
- File size and type display
- File size validation (10MB per file)
- Total file count display

### 4. **Smart UI Updates**
- Dynamic button text: "Analyze X Documents" based on selection count
- Button disabled when no files selected
- Updated labels throughout the app from "Document" to "Documents"
- Better empty state messaging

### 5. **Improved Upload Process**
- Batch processing of multiple files
- Individual file upload tracking
- Enhanced error handling for multiple files
- Better logging for debugging

### 6. **File Information Display**
- File name, size, and type shown for each selected file
- Formatted file sizes (Bytes, KB, MB, GB)
- Visual file icons for better UX

## ðŸ”§ Technical Changes:

### **AddRequest Component:**
- Added `@mantine/dropzone` for file handling
- Replaced individual file states with `selectedFiles` array
- Updated upload logic to handle multiple files sequentially
- Added file validation and size formatting utilities

### **Service Layer:**
- Updated `addRequestService` to support fileName parameter
- Enhanced API request structure for multiple files

### **UI Components:**
- Updated button labels and titles throughout
- Enhanced empty states and messaging
- Added file management controls (remove individual files)

## ðŸš€ User Experience:

### **Before:**
- Single file upload only
- Basic file input interface
- Limited file type support

### **After:**
- Multiple file upload with drag & drop
- Modern, intuitive interface
- Support for various document types
- Real-time file preview and management
- Better visual feedback and validation

## ðŸ“‹ How to Use:

1. **Click "Analyze Documents"** to open the upload dialog
2. **Drag files** into the dropzone or **click to browse**
3. **Review selected files** in the preview list
4. **Remove unwanted files** using the trash icon
5. **Click "Analyze X Documents"** to start processing
6. **Auto-refresh will monitor** all documents until processing completes

The application now provides a much more efficient workflow for users who need to analyze multiple documents simultaneously!

# Auto-Refresh Implementation Summary

## What I've implemented:

### 1. Auto-Refresh Logic
- Added auto-refresh functionality that triggers every 3 seconds when documents are in PENDING status
- Automatically stops refreshing when all documents reach final status (LEGITIMATE/SUSPICIOUS/ERROR)
- Uses `setInterval` to periodically check for updates

### 2. Visual Indicators
- Added a blue notification bar at the top when auto-refresh is active
- Shows spinning loader icon with descriptive text
- Added spinning icons next to "Processing Document" status in the table

### 3. Manual Refresh Button
- Added a "Refresh" button next to "Analyze Document" button
- Allows users to manually trigger a refresh if needed
- Uses outline variant to distinguish from primary action

### 4. Key Features:
- **Smart Detection**: Only starts auto-refresh when there are pending documents
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Stops auto-refresh when all documents are processed
- **Memory Management**: Properly cleans up intervals on component unmount
- **User Feedback**: Clear visual indicators showing refresh status
- **Manual Control**: Users can manually refresh at any time

### 5. Technical Implementation:
- Uses `useRef` to store interval reference
- Uses `useCallback` for optimized function references
- Checks document status using enum values
- Integrates with existing logging system
- Maintains existing error handling

## How it works:
1. When a document is uploaded to S3, it starts with PENDING status
2. The component detects pending documents and starts auto-refresh
3. Every 3 seconds, it fetches the latest status from the API
4. When processing completes and status changes to LEGITIMATE, auto-refresh stops
5. User sees the final result with option to view the summary

This implementation ensures users don't need to manually refresh the page to see when their document processing is complete!
